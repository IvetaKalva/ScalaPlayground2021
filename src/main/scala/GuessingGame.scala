//TODO Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number.
  //you will need to create a secret number using random
  // After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small.
  // At the end the number of tries needed should be printed.
  // It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.


  //remember we can use readLine
  //most likely a while loop
  //do not need a breakable unless you want to try it out

  //there was a game i think 20 questions where you have to guess something
